This reposistory contains code for an ESP-8266 Arduino Sketch (.ino file) that presents a simple web interface containing 8 buttons which enable 8 different digital output pins. These pins are designed to drive a hardware switch, which in turn drives the solenoids of a flag relay device.

The code is compiled and uploaded to a Lolin D1 mini ESP-8266 device, using the Arduino IDE.
